Spy Hunter Font

Created By: Dean Tersigni

Installation: Copy the Spy Hunter.fon file into your C:\Windows\Fonts folder 
(or equivalent). Most modern graphics programs don't support FON files, so 
use MS Paint to type with it.

Description: This font comes from Sunsoft's NES game Spy Hunter.
Letters and numbers work as expected, but the only symbols supported are the 
period and hyphen. However, a couple dingbats are added.
